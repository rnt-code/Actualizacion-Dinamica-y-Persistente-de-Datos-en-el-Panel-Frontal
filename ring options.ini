[CHASSIS]
**WARNING:** Every time a new key-value pair is added to this section,  
**a corresponding update **must** be made in the `type by chassis.ini` file.  
**For example: If `kitn -> "NEW"` is added here, then the section `[NEW_TYPE]`  
**must be created in `type by chassis.ini`.  
**Every key-value in this file **must** have a matching section in `type by chassis.ini`.  
**Ensure both files remain consistent to prevent errors or misconfigurations.
